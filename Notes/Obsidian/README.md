Normally, I like to use the canvas function in Obsidian because I like to organize ideas visually. However, I understand that .canvas files are not common and can only be read by Obsidian.

Therefore, I usually transfer what I've written to .md files to make them easier to read. Note that they may not be 100% formatted or in the correct order.

All .canvas files in this folder can be found as .md text files in the Md folder.

If you are interested, I recommend opening the .canvas files in Obsidian to view my notes as they were originally conceived.
