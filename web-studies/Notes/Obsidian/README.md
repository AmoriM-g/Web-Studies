I usually like to use the canvas function on obsidian as I like to organize ideas visually. Although, I understand that .canvas files are not common and can only be read by obsidian.

Because of this, I will usually transfer what was written into .md files, for an easier reading experience. Note that they might not be 100% formated, or in order.

All .canvas files in this folder can be found as .md text files in the Md folder.

If you are interested, I encourage you to open the .canvas files in Obsidian to open my annotations as they were originally intended to be viwed.
