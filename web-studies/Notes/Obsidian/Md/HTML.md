"Hypertext Markup Language"

## **Markup Language**

Is a system for defining the structure, presentation, and/or purpose of content within a digital document.

Encode text using specific vocabulary, symbols and/or syntax rules.

Not a programming Language

## **Types of Markup Languages**

### **Semantic markup**

Provides meaning to content by labeling that content's structure and purpose. Which can help browsers, search engines, and developers interpret the content correctly.

**Example:**
`<author> John Doe <author>`

### **Presentational markup**

Controls the visual appearance of content so users see content in a specific way. Defines how a text should look without specifying hot the system should render it.

**Example:**
`<b> Bold Text <b>`

### **Procedural markup**

Provides step by step commands for how content should be processed, formatted, or displayed. Instead of defining appearance, this markup directs the system on what to do with the text.
