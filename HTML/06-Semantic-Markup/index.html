        <!-- Deleted text and Inserted text -->
        <p><del>This text is Deleted</del> and <ins>this text is inserted</ins></p>
        <!-- Striked text -->
        <p><s>This text is Striked</s></p>

        <p>
            The difference between both of these is the semantic role.
            Deleted text has semantic role. It marks text as deleted, and screen readers reads them as deleted. The
            <b>del</b> tag fits when you want to mark removed text in a document or revision.
        </p>

        <p>
            Striked words have no value, meaning there is no semantic role and screen readers skips their meaning. You
            use the <b>s</b> tag when you want to show words that lost their weight but must still remain.
